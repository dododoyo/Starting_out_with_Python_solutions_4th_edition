# 1
# An object is a software entity that contains both data and procedures.

# 2
# Encapsulation refers to the combining of data and code into a single object.

# 3
# An object's internal data is usually hidden to protect it form potential corruption.

# 4
# public methods are methods that can be accessed by entities that are outside the object.
# private methods are methods that can be accessed by attributes that exist only with in the object.

# 5
# For the expression in line checkpoint 10.5 The blueprint represents the a class and the object
# represents a house.

# 6
# Earlier in the chapter from the metaphor of a cookie and a cookie cutter cookie would be an object 
# and the cookie cutter would be it's class.

# 7
# The purpose of the init method is to initialize object's data atributes
# it is executed immediately after the object is created in the memory.

# 8
# The self parameter is used to reference the specific object the method 
# is supposed to operate on.

# 9
# In python an attribute can be hidden form outside code by adding two underscore characters.

# 10
# The purpose of the __str__  method is is to display object's current state.

# 11
# The __str__ method is automatically called when you pass an pbject as an argument into the print function.

# 12
# An instance attribute is same as chracterstics of an object that is created by some class.
# each instance created by some class can have its own set of attributes.

# 13
# Since each instance will have its own attributes 10 instances will have 10 attributes.

# 14
# Generally there exists two types of methods inside a class one that can change the value of an 
# attribute and one that can't change but only get the value of the attribute the one's that can change
# the value of the attribute are called mutator methods and those who can only access it are called accessor methods.

# 15
# The typical UML diagram has three sections one for name of the class another for the list of attributes 
# in the class and the last for the methods within the class.

# 16
# Problem domain is a written discription of the real-world objects, parties and major events related to the problem.

# 17
# A description of a problem must be written by a person that adequately understand the nature of the problem.

# 18
# After identifying nouns,pronouns and refining them by listing out the duplicates and items that could 
# be represented in simple variables lastly after defining objects that can be represented with
# objects potential classes in problem domain description can be located.

# 19
# Class responsibilities are set of tasks a class must do and know.

# 20
# Depending on the problem to know classes reponsibilities you must ask yourself
# what is that a class must know and what is that a class must do those are the responsibilities.

# 21
# NO, I don't think so not always.
